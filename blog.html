<h2>My first blog entry</h2>
<a class="anchor" id="blog1"></a>
This is my first blog entry. I decided to write one because it seemed to be a good idea.

<h2>Why bothering</h2>
<a class="anchor" id="blog1"></a>
Why would I bother writing a blog?
<br>
Because research would be sterile if scientists would not disseminate it.
Also, I think that research is on its own peculiar fashion a type of art, and there is a plasure in creating and exposing it.
<br>
Why would you bother reading a blog from a natural hazard researcher?
<br>
Assuming that what written above is true, there might be a pleasure in reading it, and by means of text and photographs, getting a hint about natural hazards research.
Similarly to history, research can show us where we come from, and where we are going.
