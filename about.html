    My profession is to research alpine natural hazards from glacial and periglacial environments.
    Following my personal vision, I have been working on different topics and mass movements, including snow avalanches, river floods, permafrost creep, and glacier lake outburst floods. 
    I am always been fascinated by nature, and being an engineer, I have the tendency to think in an analythical fashion about the physical processes that shape our environment.
    <br>
    Currently, I am working on two different but interconnected aspects of alpine natural hazards: understanding the physical processes that control their dynamics, and managing the risk that they pose to humans.
