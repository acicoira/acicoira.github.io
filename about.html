    My profession is to research alpine natural hazards originating from glacial and periglacial environments.
    Following my personal vision, I have been working over the past decade on different topics and mass movements, including 
    snow avalanches, permafrost creep, and glacier lake outburst floods. 
    I have always been fascinated by natureand being an engineer, I have the tendency to think in an analythical fashion 
    about the physical processes that shape our environment.
    <br>
    Currently, I am working on two different but interconnected aspects of alpine natural hazards: 
    understanding the physical processes that control their dynamics, and managing the risk that they pose to humans.

    Since 2021, I am a researcher in the
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://eclim-research.ch/">EClim Group</a>
    within the
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://https://www.geo.uzh.ch/en/units/3g.html">Glaciology and Geomorphodynamics unit (3G)</a>
    at the
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.geo.uzh.ch/en.html">Department of Geography</a>
    of the University of Zurich.
    During the previous two years, I have been working 
    in the 
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/slab/">SLAB Laboratory</a> at EPFL Lausanne
    and at the
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.unifr.ch/geo/geomorphology/en/">Geomorphology Research Group</a>
    at the University of Fribourg.
